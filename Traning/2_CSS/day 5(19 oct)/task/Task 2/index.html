    <p>  I am Pranali Kshirsagar, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of 8.76 from Karmaveer 
        Bhaurao Patil College of Engineering. I specialize in both frontend and backend development, with skills in HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript, Flutter, Python, PHP, and MySQL. I gained hands-on experience as an intern at LeadSoft IT Solutions, where I
         developed my programming skills in C and C++. My projects, such as the Marketmate app and a food recipe website, 
        have strengthened my technical and problem-solving abilities. I've also taken on leadership roles and won awards,
         like the Rising Star in a major ideathon. I'm passionate about bringing innovative ideas to the tech industry and am 
         ready to make a meaningful impact.</p>
