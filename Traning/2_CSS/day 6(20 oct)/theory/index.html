    <p class="paragraph">After the demise of the legendary Mr. Chandrakant Sampat earlier this year, India lost another of her value investing legends, Mr. Parag Parikh, on 3rd May 2015. Mr. Parikh died in a car accident in
         Omaha, US, while on his way to the airport after attending 
         the annual shareholders’ meeting of Warren Buffett’s 
         Berkshire Hathaway. In hindsight, this sounds eerie as Mr. Parikh, a true value investor, breathed his last in the place that’s called the Mecca for value investors.
         It was in 2012 when I first saw Mr. Parag Parikh at a conference. Knowing him to be a veteran of the Indian value investing industry, I had imagined him to be an old, serious man. But he was anything but old and serious.
         
         We were meeting for the first time, but it didn’t 
         seem that way, given how he made me comfortable in his 
         company. Partly it was his limitless energy and unpretentious,
          floodlight smile that made it sound as if he was very happy
           to meet people and share his wisdom. But he also resembled 
           strongly a child who had dreams of changing the world – 
           the fund management industry in his case – 
         for the better.</p>
